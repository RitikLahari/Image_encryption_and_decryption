The Playfair cipher is a cryptographic technique invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854 but named after Lord Playfair, who popularized its use. 
It is a digraph substitution cipher, meaning it encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs) instead of single letters, making it more secure than monoalphabetic ciphers like the Caesar cipher.
